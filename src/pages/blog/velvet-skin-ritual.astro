      Why Choose Our Velvet Skin Ritual in Estepona
    </h1>
    <p>
      Summer in Estepona is beautiful with the sun, sea, and long day relaxing
      on the beach. But all that sunshine and saltwater can take a toll on your
      skin.

    <br />
    <p>
      That&rsquo;s why our Velvet Skin Ritual is the ultimate spa treatment to

      Why Choose Our Velvet Skin Ritual in Estepona
    </h3>
    <br />
    <p>
      After a sun-soaked summer on the Costa del Sol, your skin deserves a
      little extra love. Our Velvet Skin Ritual is a luxurious, multi-step
      treatment designed to restore your natural glow and leave you feeling
      renewed from head to toe.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      We begin with a full body exfoliation to gently buff away dry, sun-damaged
      skin, revealing a smoother, more radiant surface. Next, a soft facial
      peeling clears away impurities and revives your complexion, followed by
      our Face &amp; Neck Glow Mask &mdash; a deeply hydrating treatment that
      restores elasticity and luminosity where you need it most.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      To complete the ritual, we indulge your senses with a rich body butter
      effleurage &mdash; a slow, gliding massage using ultra-nourishing body
      butter to replenish moisture and soothe sun-stressed skin.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Whether you're recovering from beach days or simply craving a moment of
      calm, this ritual is your invitation to reset, recharge, and reveal your
      softest skin yet.
