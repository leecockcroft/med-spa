    What Should You Wear to Your Massage?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Comfort is key. At <strong>Massage Art Estepona</strong>, we want you to
    feel completely at ease from the moment you arrive.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>Before the massage</strong>: Wear loose, comfortable clothing
        that&rsquo;s easy to change out of. Many clients arrive in casual wear
        like yoga pants, shorts, or a sundress.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>During the massage</strong>: You&rsquo;ll be asked to undress to
        your comfort level in a private room. You&rsquo;ll be fully covered with
        soft towels or sheets throughout the session, and only the area being
        worked on will be uncovered.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        <strong>After the massage</strong>: We recommend slipping back into
        something relaxed &mdash; your body will thank you for it.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you have any questions or preferences, just let your therapist know. Your
    comfort and privacy are always our priority.
